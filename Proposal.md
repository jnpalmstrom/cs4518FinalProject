### Topic Overview

For our team's final project, 

- User takes pictures
- User has access to server that is off device
- User specifies whether they want to run ML on or off device
- App runs Tensorflow lite pre-trained model on image 
- App shows images in recyclerview that have "similar" classifications based on top 5 labels
- App has chart activities using hellocharts-android library to show performance models. These
performance charts will show avg. time to create image classification on & off device, avg. accuracy
of labels, and 5 most recent times to run image classification on & off device
